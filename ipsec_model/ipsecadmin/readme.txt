embedded IPsec - source code
~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~
short description of the ipsecadmin tool
----------------------------------------

This utility helps to configure our embedded IPsec device. It should only
be used for testing, because there is no security.

To use this tool you must first compile it: gcc -o ipsecadmin ipsecadmin.c
After successful compilation you can run it. 

Check out the example config file for the syntax.
